* Step 3. Open CMD/Terminal and go to the folder you put the .py file in, type "python3 main.py"

## Downsides and things to improve:
Pressing Q does not always terminate the while loop and only seems to work on when image window is in focus. Can't currentlly find a way to get cv2.imshow to be on top of everything aswell. Code looks messy aswell. If you switch to literally any other window prepare for your mouse to go funkey.
